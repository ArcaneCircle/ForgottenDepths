Summon System

Combat Scene
  Turn based
    Player selects action
    Player targets
    Defenders go first
    Player Attacks first, followed by Summons, followed by enemies in array order
    defend = 0
    player = 1
    summons = 2
    enemy = 3

  Enemy AI??
    Each enemy will have a pool of actions, shuffle, pop top as an Intent
    Need the pool builder for each type
    Will Attack Random Targets (target particle line?)

NICE TO HAVE: Enemy placement in overworld room: Remember direction of entrance, place it 1-2 blocks back from center opposite of door

XP Curves
  Paper Mario Style
  100 xp to level
  ceil((player level - enemy level) / 2)
  level maybe 1 + hp + (2xatk) + (2xdef) + (special mods)
  player get +5 hp, +5 mana, or +1 summon cap per levels
  player gets 1 spell point every 2 level ups (3,5,7,9,11,13,15)
  cap is 15?  (4 cap + 6 mana + 5 hp) (35/35/5)
  enemy cap should be like 50?
